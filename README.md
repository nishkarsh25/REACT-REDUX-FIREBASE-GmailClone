## API Endpoints

The backend server exposes the following API endpoints:

- `POST /register`: Register a new user.
- `POST /login`: Log in an existing user.

1. **Product Routes (`/routes/productRouter.js`):**
   - `GET /products`: Retrieves all products.
   - `POST /products`: Creates a new product.
   - `DELETE /products/:id`: Deletes a product by ID.
   - `PUT /products/:id`: Updates a product by ID.

2. **Category Routes (`/routes/categoryRouter.js`):**
   - `GET /category`: Retrieves all categories.
   - `POST /category`: Creates a new category.
   - `DELETE /category/:id`: Deletes a category by ID.
   - `PUT /category/:id`: Updates a category by ID.

3. **User Routes (`/routes/userRouter.js`):**
   - `POST /register`: Registers a new user.
   - `POST /login`: Logs in an existing user.
   - `GET /logout`: Logs out the current user.
   - `GET /refresh_token`: Refreshes the authentication token.
   - `GET /infor`: Retrieves user information (requires authentication).

These routes define the endpoints for handling product CRUD operations, category CRUD operations, and user authentication operations in the backend server. Each route corresponds to a specific action or resource in the application.

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
